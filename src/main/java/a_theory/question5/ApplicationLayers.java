    //todo p1
    // Name 3 layers of back-end architecture. Give a brief description for each.
    // 1 application layer
    // Description: controls the application's functionality
    // 2 business layer
    // Description: manages communication between an end user and a database
    // 3 data access layer
    // Description: provides an API to the application layer for managing stored data

    //todo p2
    // Do you agree with the architects? Why?
    // Yes/No YES
    // Because: a layered back-end is easier to learn and implement and there is more consistency in the back-end

    //todo p3
    // We use objects to transport data between different layers.
    // What is the difference between Entity and Dto? What is same between them?
    // Answer:  Entities are used to store data, Dto is used to transfer data (data transfer object).
    // The thing they have in common is the data that they store or transfer.
